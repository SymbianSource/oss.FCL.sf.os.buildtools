	- Fixed JON-53RMTR ("When closing applications on mainline build Error message appears").

129678
	- Change UIKON.IBY to use EIKCORE.DLL from DEBUG_DIR (i.e. udeb) rather than BUILD_DIR (i.e. urel) because CONE.DLL goes into the ROM as DEBUG_DIR (i.e. udeb). The _DEBUG-only code in CCoeEnv's constructor makes a HAL call which allocates some memory on the heap which never gets freed (it is not orphaned though, so it is not a bug). The problem for applications is that the CCoeEnv-derived-class object gets created inside a heap-mark/heap-mark-end - the heap-mark-end will therefore "notice" the HAL's lingering heap-cell as a memory-leak. EIKCORE.DLL gets around this by making a _DEBUG-only HAL call to pre-allocate this heap-cell before the heap-mark/heap-mark-end, hence why we need a DEBUG_DIR EIKCORE.DLL if we have a DEBUG_DIR CONE.DLL.
