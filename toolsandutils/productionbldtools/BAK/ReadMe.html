	<H3>Introduction</H3>
  	<P>This file provides a pre-installation point of reference for
  	Symbian OS Kit installation and configuration information.</P>

	<H3>System Requirements</H3> 

	<UL>
		<H4>Hardware</H4>

		<P>A PC with the minimum of a Pentium 1GHz processor (or
		equivalent) and 512MB of RAM running Microsoft Windows
		2000 or Windows XP.  Drive space requirements 
		depend on the number and size of Kit packages selected for
		installation.  However, the following can be considered
		as a guide :</P>

		<UL>
			<H5>Symbian OS Development Kit Drive Space Requirements</H5>

			<P>500 MB in Temp directory for installation runtime,
			in addition to the following for a full installation :</P>

			<P>-Windows 2000/XP : 1.5 GB</P>
		</UL>

		<P>NOTE: Although a Symbian OS Kit may install and run on a
		system that is less powerful than the recommended
		specification, performance may be unacceptable for
		development purposes.</P>

		<P>To run and debug OS components and applications on target
		hardware a compatible reference board or target device
		is required.</P>

		<P>The following hardware reference boards are currently
		supported :</P>
		
		<UL>
		<LI>Intel DBPXA255</LI>
		<LI>Intel DBPXA250</LI>
		</UL>
	</UL>

 	<UL>      
		<H4>Software</H4>

		<P>For OS component and application development using an
		emulator, Metrowerks CodeWarrior Development Tools for
		Symbian OS Professional Edition is required.</P>

		<P>To browse the Symbian Developer Library, a web browser
		supporting tables is needed.</P>
	</UL>


	<H3>Starting Kit Installation</H3>

	<UL>
		<P>Symbian OS Kits have a comprehensive installation mechanism.
		If installing from CD-ROM, this should run automatically on
		disc insertion.  However, if installation fails to begin :</P>

		<UL>
			<LI>ensure you have administrative privileges if running Windows NT or 2000<BR><BR></LI>

			<LI>select "Start|Run"</LI>
			<LI>enter "&lt;CD-ROM DRIVE&gt\setup.exe " into the "Open" field</LI>
			<LI>click "OK"</LI>
		</UL>

		<P>If installing from a network, the root location of the Kit
		image must first be mapped to a drive on the target system -
		double-clicking the "setup.exe" on this drive will invoke
		the installation process.</P>

	</UL>


	<H3>Kit Installation Process</H3>

	<UL>
		<H4>Destination Location</H4>

		<P>On acceptance of the Kit license agreement, the
		installation mechanism will prompt for a destination folder
		- this is the root location to where the main Kit contents
		will eventually be copied via the Symbian OS Kit Installer.<P>

		<H4>Select Components</H4>

		<P>There are two mandatory, and two optional, installations
		that are made prior to selecting specific Symbian OS Kit
		components to install.</P>

		<UL>

			<H5>Symbian OS Kit Installer (mandatory)</H5>

			<P>A utility for managing the installation of Symbian Kit
			components - launched automatically as part of the
			initial installation process.  This is the means by which
			the various component packages that form a Symbian OS Kit
			can be selected, installed, maintained and removed.</P>

			<H5>Java Runtime Environment (mandatory)</H5>

			<P>The Sun Java runtime required to run both the Symbian OS
			Kit Installer and a range of GUI developer tools that may
			be offered for installation.  This Java runtime is of a
			specific version to support the installer and these tools
			- it is a mandatory requirement of Kit installation that
			this version is installed.</P>

			<P>NOTE: The Java Runtime Environment will not install and
			run successfully on a system running at less than a 256
			colour depth.</P>

			<P>NOTE: The version currently specified and supplied is 
			1.3.1 build 01. This is detected in the registry as key
			"HKLM\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Java Runtime Environment\1.3.1".</P>

			<H5>Perl (optional)</H5>

			<P>ActiveState Perl is required by the majority of Symbian
			developer tools.  This interpreter is of a specific
			version to support these developer tools.  If the Kit
			installation is for development, and the required version
			of Perl (or later) is not installed, it is recommended 
			that this option is left checked.</P>

			<P>NOTE: Perl is supplied as a Microsoft Installer package; 
			if the Microsoft Installer system is not present on the 
			machine, this part of the installation may fail. (The 
			Microsoft Installer is available from the Microsoft web 
			site.)

			<P>NOTE: On completion of Perl and Java installations, the
			ActiveState and Sun installers may prompt for a system
			reboot in order to complete configuration - this should
			not be performed until the whole Kit has been installed.</P>

			<H5>CodeWarrior plug-ins (optional)</H5>

			<P>If a CodeWarrior IDE for Symbian OS development is
			installed, the option to update its development plug-ins
			with Kit supplied versions will be offered.  It is advised
			that this option is left checked - if the Kit is supplying
			newer versions than those already present they will be
			installed - if the Kit is supplying older versions, the
			existing plug-ins will be left untouched.</P>
		</UL>

		<P>NOTE: The "Space Required" and "Space Available" figures
		displayed at this point only refer to the space requirements
		of the Symbian OS Kit Installer and, if selected, the
		installers for the Java Runtime Environment and Perl.  The
		install locations and space requirements for the Java
		Runtime Environment and Perl are determined by their own
		installers.  The space requirements for the actual content
		of the Kit are dealt with by the Symbian OS Kit Installer.</P>


		<H4>Symbian OS Kit Installer</H4>

		<P>After the initial installation process, the Symbian OS Kit
		Installer will be invoked to manage the selection and
		installation of the component packages that form the Kit's
		contents.</P>

		<UL>

			<H5>Package Selection</H5>
    
			<P>After clicking "Next" from the Kit Installer splash screen,
			a selectable list of the Kit's available installation
			packages will be displayed.  Packages are ordered in a
			hierarchical fashion with 0 or more packages attached to
			high level categories.  It is possible to select and
			de-select packages and whole categories at will - the OS
			Kit Installer will warn of any package dependency issues
			when "Next" is clicked.</P>

			<H5>Package Confirmation and Space Requirements</H5>

			<P>The OS Kit Installer will provide a list of the dependency
			compliant packages that have been selected for
			installation, together with an estimate of both the
			current space available on the destination folder's drive
			and the space available post-package installation.</P>

			<P>NOTE: Due to differences in the files systems used by
			different variants of Windows, it is only possible to
			supply an estimate of the space available after
			installation.  The actual figure may vary from that
			displayed.</P>

			<H5>Package Retrieval, License Agreements and Installation</H5>

			<P>After confirmation of package selection and
			acknowledgement of space requirements, the OS Kit
			Installer will retrieve the selected packages from the
			installation media.  Should any of the selected packages
			have specific license requirements, these will be
			displayed post-retrieval and must be acknowledged for
			installation to continue.  On license acknowledgement,
			the selected packages will be installed to the destination
			folder, and the OS Kit Installer will undertake any system
			configuration (menu items, environment variables etc.)
			they require.</P>
		</UL>
	</UL>


	<H3>Kit Modification, Removal and Repair Process</H3>

	<UL>
		<P>The installed packages of a Symbian OS Kit can be modified by
		re-invoking the Symbian OS Kit Installer.  To do this, go to
		"Start|Settings|Control Panel|Add/Remove Programs" and
		double-click the Kit's entry on the list.  From the resultant
		dialog, select "Modify" and "Next >".  The Symbian OS Kit
		Installer will be displayed and the same process used during
		installation can be repeated.</P>

		<P>NOTE: When adding packages to a previously installed kit, the
		original media must be used from the same location i.e. if
		the base install was from a CD-ROM, subsequent package
		additions should be made using this CD-ROM from the original
		install drive.</P>
  
		<P>To remove an entire Symbian OS Kit, follow the procedure for
		modification but select "Remove" from the dialog.</P>

		<P>NOTE: The "Repair" option is currently not supported.</P>
